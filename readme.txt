STRAD 
====================

Overview
--------
This folder contains the static marketing website for **STRAD Consultants**, a structural design and civil engineering consultancy.  
It is a single‑page site built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be lightweight and easy to host on any static web server.

Main Sections

- Intro: Hero section with welcome message and primary visuals.
- About: Company story, vision, mission, and core philosophy.
- Services: Structural design consultancy and civil engineering solutions.

Project Structure
-----------------
- `index.html` – Main single‑page site.
- `css/styles.css` – Main stylesheet for layout and theme.
- `css/vendor.css` – Vendor/third‑party styles.
- `js/main.js` – Site‑specific JavaScript (interactions, smooth scroll, etc.).
- `js/plugins.js` – Third‑party plugins and helpers.
- `images/` – All images, icons, and logos used across the site.

How to Run Locally
------------------
1. Keep all project files in the same directory (as in this folder).
2. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser **or** serve the folder with any static HTTP server (recommended for best behavior with assets).
3. Make sure the relative paths to `css`, `js`, and `images` remain unchanged.

Deployment
----------
- Upload the entire folder to any static hosting provider (e.g. shared hosting, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or an Nginx/Apache web root).
- Set the document root to the folder containing `index.html`.

Customization Notes
-------------------
- Text content: Edit section copy directly in `index.html`.
- Styles and colors: Adjust variables and rules in `css/styles.css`.
- Images & logos: Replace files under `images/` with new assets, keeping filenames or updating paths in `index.html` and CSS.
